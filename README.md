# Guessthenumber

In this game, the player needs to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high, and the player continues guessing until they find the correct number. The program keeps track of the number of attempts and displays it when the player wins.

After each game, the program asks if the player wants to play again. If the answer is "yes," another game starts. If the answer is "no," the program thanks the player and exits.
